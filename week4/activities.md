1. Create a tsibble with total Holiday travellers for Victoria and Queensland from the `tourism` data set. Plot the series. What do you see?

2. Generate 4 year ahead forecasts from all four benchmarks. Plot them using `autoplot()`. Comment in the resulting forecasts.

3. Plot the residuals from the most appropriate benchmark using `gg_tsresiduals()`. What do you see?

4. Test if the residuals are white noise. What do you conclude?

5. Plot point and interval forecasts from the most appropriate benchmark.

6. Now try a decomposition forecasting model.

7. Use `accuracy()` to evaluate Which benchmark fits the data best.

8. Use a test set of last 3 years to check forecast accuracy.

9. Now use time series cross-validation to check forecast accuracy.
