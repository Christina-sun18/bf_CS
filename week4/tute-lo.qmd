# Tutorial learning objectives - Week 3

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

-   **Explain the purpose of time series transformations**, including logarithmic and Box-Cox transformations, and describe how these help stabilize variance and convert multiplicative series to additive form.

-   **Interpret decomposition plots** by analyzing trend, seasonal, and remainder components, and explain how these components combine to reconstruct the original time series. Pay attention to the grey scale on the graph.

-   **Apply STL decomposition** to transformed time series data using R, and adjust key parameters such as smoothing windows and robustness settings.
