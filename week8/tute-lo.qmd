# Tutorial learning objectives - Week 8

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. **Explain the Concept of Stationarity* (20 mins)**

  - Define stationarity as a condition where the statistical properties of a time series do not depend on time.

  - Identify whether a series is stationary using visual inspection of time plots.


2. **Apply Transformations and Differencing to Achieve Stationarity**

  - Use log or power transformations to stabilize variance in a time series.

  - Apply first-order or seasonal differencing to remove trends and seasonality.

  - Explain the purpose and effect of these techniques on the series.

3. **Express Time Series Operations Using Backshift Notation**

  - Write the series using lag notation and backshift operator (B).


4. **Use the ACF and PACF to Diagnose Time Series Properties**

  - Analyze the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) of a series.

  - Distinguish between stationary series, white noise, and potential AR/MA model structures using these tools.
