# Tutorial learning objectives - Week 6

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

- **Explain the fundamentals of exponential smoothing**, including key concepts, forecasting and smoothing equations, and the role of parameters.

- **Implement Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)** using a for loop, writing out both the forecast and smoothing equations in R.

- **Able to differentiate between custom optimization-based forecasting and automated ETS modeling** by modifying a forecasting function to minimize the sum of squared errors using the optim() function, and comparing the estimated parameters to those obtained from the ETS() function in R.

- **Understand the trend component of exponential smoothing**
