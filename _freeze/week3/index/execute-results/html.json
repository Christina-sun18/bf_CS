For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation in order to stabilise the variance.\n\n    * United States GDP from `global_economy`\n    * Slaughter of Victorian “Bulls, bullocks and steers” in `aus_livestock`\n    * Victorian Electricity Demand from `vic_elec`.\n    * Gas production from `aus_production`\n\n2. Why is a Box-Cox transformation unhelpful for the `canadian_gas` data?\n\n3. Produce the following decomposition for the number (in thousands) of of people employed in Retail Trade in the US\n\n    ```r\n    us_retail_employment <- us_employment |>\n      filter(year(Month) >= 1990, Title == \"Retail Trade\") |>\n      select(-Series_ID)\n\n    dcmp <- us_retail_employment |>\n            model(stl = STL(Employed)) \n    ```\n    \n    a. Plot the decomposition.\n    \n    b. Fit the trend component over the data [Hint: you can use `autolayer()` to add `trend` to the plot above. `trend` is one of the variables returned by `STL()`. ]\n    \n    c. Fit the trend and the seasonally adjusted [Hint: `seas_adjust` is one of the variables returned by `STL`. ]\n    \n    d. How does the seasonal shape change over time? [Hint: Try plotting the seasonal component using `gg_season()`.]\n    \n    e. What happens as you change the values of the two `window` arguments?\n    \n    f. Can you produce a plausible seasonally adjusted series? \n\n\n\n## Seminar code\n\n::: {.callout appearance=\"minimal\"}\n<i class=\"bi bi-download\"></i> [Seminar_code_week3_incomplete.R](Seminar_code_week3_incomplete){download=\"Seminar_code_week3_incomplete\"}\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [GA1](../assignments/G1.qmd) is due on Wednesday 13 March.\n* [IA2](../assignments/A2.qmd) is due on Wednesday 20 March.\n* [GA2](../assignments/G2.qmd) is due on Wednesday 27 March.\n",
