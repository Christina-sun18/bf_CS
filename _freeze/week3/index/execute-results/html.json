Find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation in order to stabilise the variance for Gas production from `aus_production`.\n\n2. Why is a Box-Cox transformation unhelpful for the `canadian_gas` data?\n\n3. Produce the following decomposition for the number (in thousands) of of people employed in Retail Trade in the US\n\n    ```r\n    us_retail_employment <- us_employment |>\n      filter(year(Month) >= 1990, Title == \"Retail Trade\") |>\n      select(-Series_ID)\n\n    dcmp <- us_retail_employment |>\n            model(stl = STL(Employed)) \n    ```\n    \n    a. Plot the decomposition.\n    \n    b. Fit the trend component over the data [Hint: you can use `autolayer()` to add `trend` to the plot above. `trend` is one of the variables returned by `STL()`. ]\n    \n    c. Fit the trend and the seasonally adjusted [Hint: `seas_adjust` is one of the variables returned by `STL`. ]\n    \n    d. How does the seasonal shape change over time? [Hint: Try plotting the seasonal component using `gg_season()`.]\n    \n    e. What happens as you change the values of the two `window` arguments?\n    \n    f. Can you produce a plausible seasonally adjusted series? \n\n4.
