Use the tsibble created from `tourism` for holiday travel in Victoria and Queensland. Plot the series to remind yourself what these look like.\n\n2. Use the `ETS()` function to fit models with additive and multiplicative errors to both series. Also let `ETS()` auto select models. Explore the fitted models and their residuals. \n\n3. Generate forecasts from the fitted models. Why is the multiplicative model needed for Victoria? \n\n4. Generate the `h02` series from the `PBS` tsibble we explored earlier using the code below.\n\n    ```r\n    h02 <- PBS |>\n      filter(ATC2 == \"H02\") |>\n      summarise(Cost = sum(Cost))\n    ```\n5. Find an `ETS` model and study it. Why has a damped trend been selected? \n\n6. Generate forecasts for the next few years. \n\n7. Combine `STL` decomposition with `ETS` to forecast the `h02` series.\n\n\n\n## Seminar code\n\n::: {.callout appearance=\"minimal\"}\n<i class=\"bi bi-download\"></i> [Seminar_code_week6.R](Seminar_code_week6.R){download=\"Seminar_code_week6.R\"}\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [IA2](../assignments/A2.qmd) is due on Wednesday 10 April.\n* [GA2](../assignments/G2.qmd) is due on Wednesday 17 April.\n* [IA3](../assignments/A3.qmd) is due on Wednesday 24 April.\n",
