Use the tsibble created from `tourism` for holiday travel in Victoria and Queensland. Plot the series to remind yourself what these look like.\n\n2. Use the `ETS()` function to fit models with additive and multiplicative errors to both series. Also let `ETS()` auto select models. Explore the fitted models and their residuals. \n\n3. Generate forecasts from the fitted models. Why is the multiplicative model needed for Victoria? \n\n4. Generate the `h02` series from the `PBS` tsibble using the code below. Plot the data and study it's features. What ETS model would be appropriate for forecasting this data?\n\n    ```r\n    h02 <- PBS |>\n    filter(ATC2 == \"H02\") |>\n    summarise(Cost = sum(Cost))\n    ```\n\n5. Find an `ETS` model and study it.\n\n6. Generate forecasts for the next few years. \n\n7. Combine `STL` decomposition with `ETS` to forecast the `h02` series.\n\n8.
