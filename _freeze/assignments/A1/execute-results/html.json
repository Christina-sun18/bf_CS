Only a couple of sentences are required. There is no need to use any fancy models or sophisticated methods. \n* **Full marks will be awarded** if you submit the required information, and are able to meaningfully justify your results in a couple of sentences in each case. \n\n### Submission\n\nYour forecasts should be submitted in moodle by **9.30am, on Monday, March 10**.\n\n\n\n\n\n<br><br><hr><b>Due: 10 March 2025</b><br><a href=https://learning.monash.edu/mod/quiz/view.php?id=3877918 class = 'badge badge-large badge-blue'><font size='+2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Submit (ETF5231)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br></a><br><br><hr><b>Due: 10 March 2025</b><br><a href=https://learning.monash.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=3877940 class = 'badge badge-large badge-blue'><font size='+2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Submit (ETF3231)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br></a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Tips\n\n* The [Data] links give you possible data to start with, but you are free to use any data you like.\n* There is no need to use any fancy models or sophisticated methods.

The student with the best score will be the winner of our forecasting competition (something really nice to have on your CV), and will also win a $100 Amazon gift voucher.\n\nNote: your assignment mark is not dependent at all on the score you obtain in the competition.\n\n\n### Scoring \n\\small\n\nLet $y=$ actual, $\\hat{y}=$ point forecast, $[\\hat{\\ell},\\hat{u}]=$ prediction interval\n\n#### Point forecasts:\n\n$$\\text{Absolute Error} = |y-\\hat{y}|$$\n\n\\vspace{-0.4cm}\n\n * Rank results for all students in class\n * Add ranks across all five items\n\n#### Prediction intervals:\n\n$$\n\\text{Interval Score} = (\\hat u - \\hat\\ell) + 10(\\hat\\ell - y)_+ + 10 (y-\\hat u)_+\n$$\n\n\\vspace{-0.5cm}\n\n* $u_+=max(u,0)$\n* Rank results for all students\n* Add ranks across all five items\n\n\n<!-- ### Submitted forecasts -->\n\n<!-- * [Q1](Q1.png); [Q1-zoom](Q1zoom.png). -->\n<!-- * [Q2](Q2.png); [Q2-zoom](Q2zoom.png). -->\n<!-- * [Q3](Q3.png); [Q3-zoom](Q3zoom.png). -->\n<!-- * [Q4](Q4.png); [Q4-zoom](Q4zoom.png). -->\n\n<!-- ### Leaderboard -->\n\n<!-- <iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_3RcdspMIL7TIaD7566bEbUEe8LHcg4UNQS1-ex-NZg/edit?usp=sharing\" width = \"110%\" height = 500></iframe> -->\n\n",
