Google closing stock price on 22 May 2024 [[Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)].\n\n**For each of these, give a point forecast and an 80% prediction interval, and explain in a couple of sentences how each was obtained.**\n\n* Prepare short justifications with your forecasts and forecast intervals explaining in no more than 50-70 words how these were obtained. Only a couple of sentences are required. There is no need to use any fancy models or sophisticated methods. \n* **Full marks will be awarded** if you submit the required information, and are able to meaningfully justify your results in a couple of sentences in each case. \n* Your forecasts should be submitted via [google form](https://forms.gle/FJnakDEjp9mNADyK7) by 11.55pm on due date.\n\n**Tips**\n\n* The [Data] links give you possible data to start with, but you are free to use any data you like.\n* There is no need to use any fancy models or sophisticated methods. Simple is better for this assignment. The methods you use should be understandable to any high school student.\n\n**Forecasting competition**\n\n* Once the true values in each case are available, we will come back to this exercise and see who did the best using the scoring method described in class. The student with the best score will be the winner of our forecasting competition (something really nice to have on your CV), and will also win a $100 Amazon gift voucher.\n\nNote: your assignment mark is not dependent at all on the score you obtain in the competition.\n\n\n\n<br><br><hr><b>Due: 6 March 2024</b><br><a href=https://learning.monash.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=1450536 class = 'badge badge-large badge-blue'><font size='+2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Submit (ETF5231)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br></a><br><br><hr><b>Due: 6 March 2024</b><br><a href=https://learning.monash.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=1450536 class = 'badge badge-large badge-blue'><font size='+2'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Submit (ETF3231)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br></a>\n",
