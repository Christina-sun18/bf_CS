Create a tsibble with total Holiday travellers for Victoria and Queensland from the `tourism` data set. Plot the series. What do you see?\n\n2. Generate 4 year ahead forecasts from all four benchmarks. Plot them using `autoplot()`. Comment in the resulting forecasts.\n\n3. Plot the residuals from the most appropriate benchmark using `gg_tsresiduals()`. What do you see?\n\n4. Test if the residuals are white noise. What do you conclude?\n\n5. Plot point and interval forecasts from the most appropriate benchmark.\n\n6. Now try a decomposition forecasting model.\n\n7. Use `accuracy()` to evaluate Which benchmark fits the data best.\n\n8. Use a test set of last 3 years to check forecast accuracy.\n\n9. Now use time series cross-validation to check forecast accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n## Seminar code\n\n::: {.callout appearance=\"minimal\"}\n<i class=\"bi bi-download\"></i> [Seminar_code_week4.R](Seminar_code_week4.R){download=\"Seminar_code_week4.R\"}\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [GA2](../assignments/G2.qmd) is due on Wednesday 10 April.\n",
