We have introduced various functions for time series graphics include `autoplot()`, `gg_season()`, `gg_subseries()`, `gg_lag()` and `ACF`. Use these functions to explore the quarterly tourism data for the Snowy Mountains.\n\n   ```r\n   snowy <- tourism |> filter(Region == \"Snowy Mountains\")\n   ```\n\n   What do you learn?\n\n2. Which time plot corresponds to which ACF plot?\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/acf-quiz-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Assignments\n\n* [IA1](../assignments/A1.qmd) is due on Wednesday 06 March.\n* [GA1](../assignments/G1.qmd) is due on Wednesday 13 March.\n* [IA2](../assignments/A2.qmd) is due on Wednesday 20 March.\n",
