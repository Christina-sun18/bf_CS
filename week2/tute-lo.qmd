# Tutorial learning objectives - Week 2

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

-   **Import time series data into R**

    -   Successfully read time series data from CSV and Excel files.
    -   Set and verify your working directory using `getwd()` and `setwd()` to avoid file path errors.
    -   Recognize the importance of proper file import for all future assignments.

-   **Convert data frames to tsibbles**

    -   Use `as_tsibble()` to convert a data frame into a time series tibble (tsibble).
    -   Understand key components of a tsibble:
        -   the **time index** and its granularity,
        -   the **key** variable(s)

-   Visualize time series data

    -   Create line plots using `geom_line()` from **ggplot2**.
    -   Use the `autoplot()` function for quick and easy time series visualization.
