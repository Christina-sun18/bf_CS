# Tutorial learning objectives - Week 3

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

-   **Recognize common patterns in time series data**

    -   Identify and describe key time series components: **trend**, **seasonal**, and **cycle**.

-   **Visualize seasonal patterns using appropriate plots**

    -   Create **seasonal plots** using `gg_season()`.
    -   Create and interpret **subseries plots** using `gg_subseries()`.
    -   Understand that subseries lines—not just the horizontal average—reveal how seasonality changes over time.

-   **Apply cross-sectional visualisation techniques**

    -   Visualise and explore relationships between variables.

-   **Interpret autocorrelation and lag plots**

    -   Understand and interpret **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** plots.
    -   Recognise common time series behaviour based on **ACF and lag plots**.
