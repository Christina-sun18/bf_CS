# Tutorial learning objectives - Week 5

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. **Describe the forecasting workflow** and understand the sequence of steps involved in building and evaluating forecasting models.

2. **Apply benchmark forecasting methods** including mean, naïve, seasonal naïve (snaive), and drift methods and understand their appropriate use cases.

3. **Interpret residual diagnostics** using visual tools such as residual plots and histograms to assess forecast accuracy and model performance. Understand fitted values and residuals.

4. Understand how **forecast uncertainty** is represented through distributions and how this connects to histograms of residuals. 

5. **Impact of transformations** on the distribution shape, mean, and median.

6. **Combine decomposition and forecasting**. 

7. **Evaluate point forecast accuracy** inlcuding understanding forecast error metrics such as RMSE, MAPE, MASE, RMSSE.
