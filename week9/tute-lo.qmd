# Tutorial learning objectives - Week 7

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. **Explain the Intuition Behind Exponential Smoothing** 

  - Describe how exponential smoothing captures trend and seasonality.

  - Interpret the roles of smoothing parameters and initial states in forecasting.

2. **Compare Exponential Smoothing with Benchmark Models**

  - Identify similarities and differences between exponential smoothing and simpler models such as the mean and na√Øve forecasts.

  - Recognize scenarios where exponential smoothing offers an advantage over these benchmark models.

3. **Understand ETS Model Components**

  - Distinguish between additive and multiplicative forms of error, trend, and seasonality.

  - Explain how these components work together in an ETS model.

  - Analyze how smoothing parameters and initial states affect model behavior and forecast outputs.
