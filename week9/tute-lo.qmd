# Tutorial learning objectives - Week 9

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:


1. **Identify AR and MA Terms from ACF and PACF Plots**
  - Interpret autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots.
  - Use these plots to decide on appropriate AR and MA orders for ARIMA models.
  
2. **Fit and Evaluate ARIMA Models**
  - Use the `ARIMA()` function to fit non-seasonal ARIMA models.
  - Check model residuals to see if the model fits well.
  - Compare different ARIMA models and understand how drift, differencing, and lag order affect forecasts.

3. **Understand and Use Backshift Notation**
  - Write ARIMA models using backshift notation.
  - Forecast using the backshift notation.
