So if you score 8/10 for IA3 and 5/10 for GA3 your mark for Assignment 3 will be 8*0.7+5*0.3=7.1 out of 10. Hence, it is important to make sure that groups are performing at the highest standard.\nPresentation requirements: using Rmarkdown, and should converted the assignment into pdf output file unless otherwise specified.\nCriteria for marking: Provided the task has been completed and your code runs without errors, full marks will be awarded. Marks will be deducted for incomplete tasks or if there are errors.\nPenalties for late lodgement: The University has a standard penalty for late submission. See the Marking and Feedback Procedure for more information\nAdditional information: Additional information regarding this assessment will be provided during the scheduled class time and on Moodle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Participation - ETF5231 Students ONLY\n\n\n\nGroup participation rules for group assignments (GAs): It is expected that all group members participate equally to the group assignments. It sometimes helps to keep a log of the tasks each member is to complete. This may assist in keeping some balance throughout the semester. To ensure that all group members are contributing the following rules will apply for all the group assignments throughout the semester.\nEvery group member has the right to express concern/dislike in terms of a group member being absent from group activities. This has to be expressed directly to me (and only me) via a formal email stating facts that have hindered the operations of the group (saying I do not like George because he is tall is not a reason for expressing concern). If at least two such complaints are submitted during the completion of an assignment, the group member concerned will receive a warning. If the situation is not improved during the next assignment and another two complaints are again submitted, the group member will be immediately removed from the group and will be expected to complete the rest of the group assignments alone."

Your function should fix this problem by generating more observations than required and then discarding the first few observations.

If you’ve already done one of ETX2250/ETC1010 or something equivalent you should be fairly familiar with these concepts and probably will not need much help. But if you’re new to R and the tidyverse, then you will need to get yourself up-to-speed.\n\nTo get started first look through the Appendix in the textbook.\nDuring the tutorials you will work your way through chapters 1-5 and 8 of learnr.numbat.space. This is material we have prepared for you and other Monash students working in R.\nThere are lots of online resources available to help you cover the necessary material. Here are my suggestions:\n\nRead the first four chapters of “ModernDive”.\n\nWork through the “RYouWithMe” course.\n\nYou don’t need to do everything in these links, but work on the parts where you are weakest. If you spend about 3-4 hours on this, you should cover enough of the relevant background to be ready for the rest of the unit.\n\nYour tutors will be in your tutorial class to assist you should you need it but you should do these at your own pace to understand the concepts."

    "text": "It is expected that all group members participate equally to the group assignments. It sometimes helps to keep a log of the tasks each member is to complete. This may assist in keeping some balance throughout the semester. To ensure that all group members are contributing the following rules will apply for all the group assignments throughout the semester.\nEvery group member has the right to express concern/dislike in terms of a group member being absent from group activities. This has to be expressed directly to me (and only me) via a formal email stating facts that have hindered the operations of the group (saying I do not like George because he is tall is not a reason for expressing concern). If at least two such complaints are submitted during the completion of an assignment, the group member concerned will receive a warning. If the situation is not improved during the next assignment and another two complaints are again submitted, the group member will be immediately removed from the group and will be expected to complete the rest of the group assignments alone.\nIn my involvement with group assignments we have rarely needed to enforce such rule so I do no expect any major problems here. However they will be enforced if need be. I hope this is clear.\nWe need only one submission per group for each group assignment."

You are to submit both an “GA2_GroupNo.Rmd” file and a compiled “GA2_GroupNo.pdf” file for your assignment.\nFollow the assignment questions/instructions to complete some specific tasks. Add code were necessary (you can add more R chunks if and where you need to) and text to answer the questions where necessary. Keep within the suggested word restrictions in order to get full marks (marks will be deducted for grossly going over the word limit). This is to encourage you to be concise in your writing.\nYou will be using this data in future assignments as you will build on the analysis you perform in this assignment. Furthermore, in the final assignment you will need to submit an .Rmd file that you will develop for all the assignment tasks throughout the semester. Marks will be allocated for code that runs without errors and produces the correct output. Make sure that every time your code works without errors. If you need help with this, please ask during consultation times. Keeping detailed comments in your program is always good practice (see for example the programs we are using in the lectures). This will help you remember in week 12 why you did certain things in week 4.\nFiles for download:\n\nDownload the template\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download GA2_template.Rmd\n\n\n\n\nDownload the data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download GA_data.csv\n\n\n\n\n\nDue: 27 March 2024  Submit (ETF5231)"

The first line of your function definition should be\ngenerate_arma &lt;- function(n = 100, c = 0, phi = NULL, theta = NULL, sigma = 1)\nHere phi and theta are vectors of AR and MA coefficients. Your function should return a numeric vector of length n.\nFor example generate_arma(n = 50, c = 2, phi = c(0.4, -0.6)) should return 50 observations generated from the model y_t = 2 + 0.4y_{t-1} - 0.6y_{t-2} + \\varepsilon_t where \\varepsilon \\sim N(0,1).\n\nThe noise should be generated using the rnorm() function.\n\nYour function should check stationarity and invertibility conditions and return an error if either condition is not satisfied. You can use the stop() function to generate an error. The model will be stationary if the following expression returns TRUE:\n!any(abs(polyroot(c(1,-phi))) &lt;= 1)\nThe MA parameters will be invertible if the following expression returns TRUE:\n!any(abs(polyroot(c(1,theta))) &lt;= 1)\n\nThe above function sets the first value of every series to 0. Your function should fix this problem by generating more observations than required and then discarding the first few observations. You will need to consider how many observations to discard, to prevent the returned series from being affected by the initial values. Test that it is working by checking that the first few values of the series are close to the mean of the series, even when c is a large value.\n\nPlease submit your solution as a .R file.\n\n\nDue: &lt;a href= class = ‘badge badge-large badge-blue’&gt;  Submit"
